# Iterative-Vs.-Recursive-Methods-
This is the repository that contains my first project from my Algorithms and Data Structures for Object Oriented Design class in SWE @ Western University
The main idea is to compare the amount of time it takes for a machine to run the same method from an iterative design or a reccursive design. 
It is clear from this excersize that the iterative design of methods is always more quicker thant he reccursive design.
